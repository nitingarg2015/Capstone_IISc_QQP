## Objective: 

Identification of Quora question pairs with the same intent

## Problem Statement

Quora is a platform to gain and share knowledge on any topic. It allows people to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. This equips people to learn from each other and to understand topics in diverse subjects. Over 100 million users visit Quora every month, and a lot of them ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question. This also leads to an inefficient system for writers, as they spend more time on answering multiple versions of the same question. 

The goal of this project is 
1. To use NLP, ML algorithms and create an application to classify whether Quora question pairs that are already asked are duplicate or not.
2. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
